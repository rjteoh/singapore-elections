An analysis of Singapore electoral data

Main project code is found in "ElectionAnalysis_National".
The stargazer html tables should be pretty self-explanatory.
Cleaned data files are found in "Data", which also contains the raw files and basic cleaning code in sub-folders. 

Despite not observing any notable heteroskedacity in the data, I calculated a second set of results using robust ses for completeness. The stargazer tables for these results are saved in "Robust Results" - the monovariate regressions are largely unchanged but there were some significant changes to the multivariate regression results.
